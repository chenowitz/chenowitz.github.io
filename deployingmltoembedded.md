**Project description:** Blah blah blah

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

For a while, I've been obsessed with the idea of tinyML, deploying machine learning models on edge devices. My background is in mechatronics. I had a fair bit of experience integrating hardware and software, but data engineering, DevOps and MLOps were all very opaque to me. Generally, no individual owns the whole process end-to-end, but I like having the 10,000 foot overview. 

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
